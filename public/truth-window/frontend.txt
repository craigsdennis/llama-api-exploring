I want to create an app that uses the Webcam to snap photos, and enables
photo uploads.
Each photo should have separate container and we'll show there streaming descriptions from /api/photos/describe and JSON outputs /api/photos/extract. Let's work with the front end first.

Show the photo before sending it and make a button that says Describe.

Use POST to submit JSON and send the image as a base64 dataURL. I want the vibe to be in Meta Dark Mode style and throw in a little Cloudflare Orange where appropriate.
